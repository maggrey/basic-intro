# Introduction
Name is Michael Aggrey, Computer Science Major. I am a transfer student from Butte College. I originate from Ghana a country on the coast of West Africa. I love the dynamics in programming. Although I am not super good at it. I love to see myself make someting out of writing code. I am a senior, and very excited to graduate next year.
